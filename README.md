# BetterThanVim
**BetterThanVim** (BTV) is an `ed`-inspired command-based command line text editor.

## Is BTV really better than Vim?
Yes.

Let me explain:
1. BTV, like `ed`, allows you to edit using an older interface like a printer or typewriter. [Yes, actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vmOTvRXZ0E).
2. BTV is relatively lightweight, whereas Vim is highly complex and includes many unnecessary features like a built-in scripting language and syntax highlighting.
3. BTV has less commands/symbols to memorize.
4. BTV is written in Rust. You might be wondering: why does this make BTV better? Well, just take a look at [this crab](https://www.rustacean.net/).
5. BTV doesn't steal you data. Not saying that Vim does, I'm just saying that BTV doesn't.

## Technologies used
1. [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) (with [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo))
2. [ed](https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/)
3. [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) (unfortunately)
4. BetterThanVim (fortunately)
